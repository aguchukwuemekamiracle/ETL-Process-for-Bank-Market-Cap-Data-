# Data Engineering Assignment: ETL Process for Bank Market Cap Data - Completed

I have successfully completed the data engineering assignment for extracting, transforming, and loading bank market cap data. I followed the provided instructions and implemented the ETL process using Python and various Python libraries.

Summary of Completed Tasks:

    Extract: I extracted bank market cap data from the JSON files bank_market_cap_1.json and bank_market_cap_2.json and stored the data in a pandas DataFrame.

    Transform: I transformed the market cap values from USD to GBP using exchange rate data from the exchange_rates.csv file. I also rounded the market cap values to 3 decimal places and renamed the column from Market Cap (US$ Billion) to Market Cap (GBP$ Billion).

    Load: I loaded the transformed data into a CSV file named bank_market_cap_gbp.csv.

Additional Steps Taken:

    I logged each phase of the ETL process (extract, transform, load) using a timestamp and message format.
    I used appropriate functions for each ETL phase.
    I provided screenshots of selected outputs.

Learning Outcomes:

    I have gained hands-on experience in applying data extraction techniques to handle JSON data.
    I have enhanced my understanding of data transformation using pandas.
    I have learned how to load data into a CSV file for storage and analysis.
    I have implemented logging to track the ETL process, which is crucial for data lineage and troubleshooting.

Overall, I have successfully completed the data engineering assignment and demonstrated my proficiency in performing ETL operations using Python.
